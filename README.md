### Purpose and Functionality
Purpose: Kovid aims to present users an interactive Cambridge map that embeds operation status and Covid-related information about Cambridge businesses. This makes it easy for customers to find businesses that suit their needs especially under the Covid situation because businesses have to change operation statuses and policies regularly in response to the disease. By presenting consumers the services that are available to them, Kovid also increases market efficiency, helping businesses make more profit.
